/*
Given a string, determine if a permutation of the string could form a palindrome.
For example,
"code" -> False, "aab" -> True, "carerac" -> True.
*/

This question is similar to: Longest palindrome

/**
 * If a string with an even length is a palindrome, every character in the string must always occur an even number of times. 
 * If the string with an odd length is a palindrome, every character except one of the characters must always occur an even number of times. 
 * Thus, in case of a palindrome, the number of characters with odd number of occurences can't exceed 1
 * (1 in case of odd length and 0 in case of even length).

/**
 * Approach 1: HashMap
 * Algorithm
 * From the discussion above, we know that to solve the given problem, 
 * we need to count the number of characters with odd number of occurences in the given string s. 
 * To do so, we can also make use of a hashmap. This map takes the form (character_i, number of occurences of character_i).
 * 
 * We traverse over the given string s. 
 * For every new character found in s, we create a new entry in the map for this character with the number of occurences as 1. 
 * Whenever we find the same character again, we update the number of occurences appropriately.
 * 
 * At the end, we traverse over the map created and find the number of characters with odd number of occurences. 
 * If this count happens to exceed 1 at any step, we conclude that a palindromic permutation isn't possible for the string s. 
 * But, if we can reach the end of the string with count lesser than 2, we conclude that a palindromic permutation is possible for s.
 * 
 * Complexity Analysis
 * Time complexity : O(n). 
 * We traverse over the given string s with n characters once. 
 * We also traverse over the map which can grow upto a size of n in case all characters in s are distinct.
 * Space complexity : O(n). The hashmap can grow upto a size of n, in case all the characters in s are distinct.

class Solution {
    public boolean canPermutePalindrome(String s) {
        HashMap <Character, Integer> map = new HashMap<> ();
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            map.put(s.charAt(i), map.getOrDefault(s.charAt(i), 0) + 1);
        }
        int count = 0;
        for (char key: map.keySet()) {
            count += map.get(key) % 2;
        }
        
        return count <= 1;
    }
}

/**
 * Approach 2: HashSet
 * Algorithm
 * A modification of the last approach could be by making use of a set for keeping track of 
 * the number of elements with odd number of occurences in s. 
 * For doing this, we traverse over the characters of the string s. 
 * Whenver the number of occurences of a character becomes odd, we put its entry in the set. 
 * Later on, if we find the same element again, lead to its number of occurences as even, 
 * we remove its entry from the set. 
 * Thus, if the element occurs again(indicating an odd number of occurences), its entry won't exist in the set.
 * 
 * Based on this idea, when we find a character in the string s that isn't present in the set
 * (indicating an odd number of occurences currently for this character), we put its corresponding entry in the set. 
 * If we find a character that is already present in the set
 * (indicating an even number of occurences currently for this character), we remove its corresponding entry from the set.
 * 
 * At the end, the size of set indicates the number of elements with odd number of occurences in s. 
 * If it is lesser than 2, a palindromic permutation of the string s is possible, otherwise not.
 * 
 * Complexity Analysis
 * Time complexity : O(n). We traverse over the string s of length n once only.
 * Space complexity : O(n). The set can grow upto a maximum size of n in case of all distinct elements.

            }
        }
        
        return set.size() <= 1;

/**
 * Approach 3: Using Array instead of Set
 * Algorithm
 * We traverse over s and update the number of occurences of the character just encountered in the map (an array). 
 * But, whevenever we update any entry in map, we also check if its value becomes even or odd. 
 * We start of with a count value of 0. 
 * If the value of the entry just updated in map happens to be odd, 
 * we increment the value of count to indicate that one more character with odd number of occurences has been found. 
 * But, if this entry happens to be even, 
 * we decrement the value of count to indicate that the number of characters with odd number of occurences has reduced by one.
 * 
 * But, in this case, we need to traverse till the end of the string to determine the final result, 
 * because, even if the number of elements with odd number of occurences may seem very large at the current moment, 
 * but their occurences could turn out to be even when we traverse further in the string s.
 * At the end, we again check if the value of count is lesser than 2 to conclude that a palindromic permutation is possible for the string s.
 * 
 * Complexity Analysis
 * Time complexity : O(n). We traverse over the string s of length n once only.
 * Space complexity : O(1). A array of constant size(128) is used.
